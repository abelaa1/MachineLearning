In order to run my code please download SL.py and both datasets from

https://gatech.box.com/s/gs0a59whfrgf8r9ypgptm0hzo2lrnx2z

make sure that you have installed the following:

pandas
sklearn
tensorflow
keras
numpy
matplotlib

In order to run code under DATA uncomment only the dataset for the example you wish to run (NOT BOTH AT ONCE)
Find the example you wish you run (KNN, NN, etc) for the graph you want to produce (Learning Curve, Validation Curve) under the dataset (diabetes, iris) that you uncommented

only do one graph at a time to avoid conflict
