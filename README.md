# Machine Learning Projects Portfolio

This repository showcases the projects and concepts I worked on during a comprehensive Machine Learning course. The focus of the course spanned three key areas of Machine Learning: **Supervised Learning**, **Unsupervised Learning**, and **Reinforcement Learning**. Below is an overview of these topics and how they were applied.

## üîç Supervised Learning
Supervised Learning is at the heart of many modern technologies, from voice recognition to email spam filtering. In this course, I developed practical skills to:
- Apply supervised learning models to real-world datasets.
- Build predictive systems capable of recognizing patterns such as detecting fraud or classifying images.
- Evaluate and interpret model outputs to make informed decisions.

### **Key Skills:**
- Classification and regression tasks
- Feature engineering and model optimization
- Performance evaluation (e.g., precision, recall, and F1 score)

## üìä Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised Learning is about uncovering hidden patterns and structures in data, even when labels aren't available. It powers technologies like movie recommendations and customer segmentation. In this course, I:
- Implemented clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques.
- Explored feature selection and transformation.
- Used optimization techniques to reveal meaningful data patterns.

### **Key Skills:**
- K-Means and hierarchical clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Data visualization and interpretation

## ü§ñ Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement Learning focuses on decision-making and action-taking in dynamic environments. Inspired by behaviorist psychology, this area of Machine Learning is used in robotics, gaming, and autonomous systems. During the course, I:
- Built agents that learn optimal strategies through trial and error.
- Designed reward functions to guide behavior.
- Applied RL techniques to environments such as games and control systems.

### **Key Skills:**
- Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)
- Q-Learning and policy optimization
- Environment simulation and reward engineering
